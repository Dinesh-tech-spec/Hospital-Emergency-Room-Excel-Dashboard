# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Excel-Dashboard

🏥 Interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard! 📊
Excited to share my latest project — a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard built using Excel! This dashboard gives a comprehensive snapshot of key ER metrics like patient volume, wait time, satisfaction scores, age group trends, and departmental referrals.

In this project, I learned how to:
 🔍 Analyze healthcare data effectively
 📈 Visualize patient trends and performance indicators
 📅 Track monthly changes and gender-based insights
 📊 Present real-time insights with slicers and interactive charts

Key metrics included:
🧍‍♂️ 480 Patients this month
⏳ 34.43 Minutes Average Wait Time
⭐ 5.16 Patient Satisfaction Score
📊 Gender & Attendance Status Distribution
🏥 Department-Wise Referrals & Admission Ratios

This hands-on experience has really strengthened my data analysis and dashboarding skills — especially within the healthcare domain.
